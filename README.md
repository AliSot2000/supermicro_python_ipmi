# Python Bindings for the Supermicro IPMI Interface

This is a work in progress. I needed to access the power settings of the ipmi interface for automatisation and created this small api for it. It uses the webinterface of the ipmi_interface. Feel free to modify and expand this small api for the other functionalities of the IPMI. Maybe I'll feel like doing so myself sometime.

As a sidenote, the IPMI Interface with which this api was tested was a X9SCM-F
